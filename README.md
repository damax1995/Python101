# Python101
In this repository I will upload al the .py files from the Python101 book.
This book has lots of exercises and I consider a great way to start in the Python world.
The exercises will be quite basic at the beginig, just to make the user comfortable with the languaje; and when we arrive to the end of the book it will get harder.
